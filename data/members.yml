  bio: "Cyril already had 2 lives. The first started in France where he was born and worked as a Windows C++ engineer. The second when he moved to San Francisco and decided to shift to the open-source world, working with Ruby on Rails and later with Ember.js. This gave him a chance to contribute to several open-source projects like Ember Data, Ember.js, Koala and others. He can also be found surfing along California's coast or taking <a href='http://sanfranciscophotoblog.us' target='_blank'>photographs</a>."

  bio: "David has been doing web development since he was a teenager.  He is a full-stack developer whose wanderlust has taken him to projects as diverse as public-facing startup apps and enterprise corporate real estate management software.  Previously working with J2EE, he now primarily focuses on Ruby on Rails, Ember.js and related technologies.  When he's not helping bring client visions to life he indulges in his passions for open source and European history."
